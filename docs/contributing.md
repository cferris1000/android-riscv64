# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to making
Android/riscv64 better!

## Contribution process

This github project is solely for issue tracking/discussion/documentation
purposes. All Android/riscv64 work is being done directly in
[AOSP](https://source.android.com/).

Consult the regular AOSP
[Contributing](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/contribute#contribute-to-the-code)
documentation for more information on how to send us your patches.

Note that changes to projects under `external/` (other than to
`Android.bp` files) typically need to go to the upstream open source
project in question first, and will then be merged into AOSP from
there. In many cases, the `METADATA` file will point you to the
upstream source, but feel free to ask here if not!
